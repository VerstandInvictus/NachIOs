# NachIOs
A collection of Hook.io and other scripts for connecting the Nachapp.com API to other services, mainly IFTTT.

ifthentrack.py - IFTTT Maker -> Hook.io script that updates a specified Nach tracker with today's date and an arbitrary value.

ifthenstep.py - IFTTT Maker -> Hook.io script that adds a step to a specified Nach tracker. Can set up to 2 notes as well as subject, and is designed for use with IFTTT email (subject -> title, body -> note, attachment URL -> note) but I also use it for IFTTT Pocket.
